## Advanced practical sessions on Radar Polarimetry

This repository contains practical sessions offered at the ESAâ€™s 7th Advanced Training Course on Radar Polarimetry which took place in Toulouse, France, June 12-16, 2023.

Since original data provided has outdated environemnt and a lot of unecessary and missing modules, the code here was cleaned and updated with a compact conda environment.

### Usage
For each of the days there are numbered theoretical materials and, if available, solutions to practical tasks in html format. 

*Environment file to the code will be added later.*
